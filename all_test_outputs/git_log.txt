    - Fixed the calculation of the metric for calculating the cutoff for the summary heatmap for the ribosome. It's a bit complicated because it happens that the ribosome metric is a ratio and its the only ratio which adds a specific complexity to the whole program so what I wrote is like a terrible contingency

    Continued refactoring: Instead of having all fail and warn cutoffs as different parts of the _figinfo dictioanry, make a dictionary of dictionaries for both so that you can traverse the fail / warn cutoffs in teh same way as required.
    
    Still need to bugfix. I tore up alot of code to make this work so it needs alot of help
    
    Moved some general code to the Sam_PyUtils files and deleted some old / defunct functions

    - Added new histograms that are at what I think is a more appropriate bin density .5. It's much more clear what the bad samples are
    
    - The 95% confidence interval is now appropriately plotted

    Following Changes
    
    1) Title page with all the input/output information/and cutoffs
        1a) Sequence contamination cutoff made more specific
        2) Gene expression using actual value
        3) Note: It would take too much time to change the GBC to show the KS statistic so I'm not focusing on this now
    2) Legends should have fixed positions
    3) Ribosomal RNA plot now showing fail/warn/slope in percents
        a) Additional information given for slope line so it is more clear what it is.
    4) Thinner histogram lines
    5) Clearer and less cramped labels for Sequence Contamination Plotsi

    Finished "object oriented" rework. Finally got to tap into the fruit of this work which is that it was easy to modify the plot so that GC and hist do not need to be included and return a 6 panel plot if neither are This still isn't as good as true OO but it's ok for the purposes of this plot.

    Began work to save all the variables as a dictionary which is then piped to the other subfunctions. It's work but I think it is better than having so many arguments need to be sent to each
    function as much of it is abstracted at this point including typesizes etc. I think it is analogous to initializing a class at this point I almost wonder if I should have written a subfigure class with methods which plot particular things. It is getting to that point. I don't think that is necessary though this will be able to do most of the functionality. The main functionality being able to modify variables passed to the helper functions based on the initial
    ized with, especially 8 vs 6 plots as the spacing needs to change. We will see this is kind of a big step for me and I've never done organization like this and don't have a senior dev or something to ask what the best option is so it's unlikely to be perfect.

    Staggered fail marker so it can stack with warn more easily. It is lower so it isn't obscured as much by the actual fail / warn panel when they occur (Could consider decreasing the size of these)

    There have been alot of changes, which I haven't been keeping line by line track of partially been trying to get everything done before break. These changes primarily reflect the overall goal of getting the statistical cutoffs correct and adding particular features so that individuals can add custom cutoffs for particular features etc.

    Two major changes.
    
    First, for the violin plots, the warn and fail markers now work for both the adapters and the overrep.
    
    Second specifying the -bgd argument should work correctly now.

    Largely finished code functionaliation and cleanup. There is more I could do surely but I think at this point we are very likely to run into diminshing returns. Highly considering removing one of the
    subplots for the contamination metric. I'm not sure why we need to care about both and it honestly looks really ugly.

    Added a new set of histogram data, this with a different breakpoint .25 which should be less noisy than .1
    
    Begin some really guts oriented work to functionalize some heavily repeated and thus inefficient code. Specifically I wrote a function which decides whether or not to insert the fail/warn box and removed all manual instances of this code that existed

    Changed colors back to gold
    
    Deleted lots of useless print statments
    
    Rewrote code so that the 8th plot is performing the proper statistical test IE, by number of expressed genes rather than by comparing the distributions as before.

Date:   Sat Nov 12 23:08:44 2022 -0600

    Finished the changes I made regarding making text sizes more legible. It is worth noting that there will need to be a change regarding global variables, or functionalizing the way the axes are generated for this to be maintainable. Putting this off for now.
    
    Continued to clean up old code and function. At this point it may be better to look at an earlier branch to look at some of Gaurav's old features that became defunct. etc.
    
    Cleaned the folder of old pdfs that were cloggint he difrectory.

    In the middle of a bunch of changes: Making an intermediate git commit to track the changes and my progress
    
    - Fixed issues with the fail/warn markers where they were too narrows because i was using the standard error rather than the standard deviation.
    
    - Fixed issues with the axes and axis text for plot 8, gene historame, changed the X-axis name
    
    - A lot of work changing various sizes of text. Unfortunately it isn't well standardized so it is alot of hunting for fontsize arguments. In the future I am curious if it is possible to functionalize some of these paramaters so as to call something resemblin g astandard plot. i do this often in R so I assume matplotlib offers a similar functionalizty.
    
    - I am starting to put some work into cleaning up the code, deleting old defunct code, print statements etc.

    Made a series of changes to make this work better. Mostly, got the gene body plot to work in the quest call format and now the warn and fail markers can be set using pvalue distributions. Some bugfixing but not finished regarding printing the histograms, which currently seems to be bugged and hard coded to take certain x values. Needs to work dynamically based on the range tracked by the histplot
